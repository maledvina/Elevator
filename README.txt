UPDATED!

1. ElevatorAction (Main), Person, List, Node, Queue, QueueList, SLList, Stack, StackList .java
	-They should all be in same directory

2. ElevatorAction names.txt(example) instructions.txt(example)
	-Name list first then instructions

3. I know that i didn't seperate WAIT, PICK_UP etc into seperate methods BUT i don't think it's that messy? 
	I think its pretty easy to follow along.

4.I think it all works???
